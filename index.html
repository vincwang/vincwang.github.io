      <p class="introduction">I am a senior at The Pennsylvania State University majoring in Computer Science, with two minors in Mathematics and Statistics. <br><br> I have had multiple internship/co-op experiences. My first internship was at SoShare Mobile as a functional tester in a web-based system team. I also worked at Edible Arrangements as a web developer, where I developed and improved several web applications. <br><br> Most recently, I worked as a software engineer co-op at Lutron Electronics on a Smart Home product (Caséta Wireless). Over 8 months of work, I was involved in multiple projects including building an user activity recommendation system, developing an “Away” feature on an iOS application and a system-wide data report generator. <br><br>I am currently seeking an internship position in Software Engineering for Summer 2017.

          		<img src="images/projectPicture/lutroncasetawireless.jpg"/> <br><br>
              	<p>This is an iOS project that I was involved in during my time at Lutron Electronics, working on a Smart Home control system called Caseta Wireless. This feature will allow users to set an "Smart Away" mode for the house, that will randomly change the lights in the house at night time to make a home appeared "lived-in" while it's unoccupied. <br> <br>
              	My main responsibilities include co-designing the feature spec and implementing the functionalities on iOS. The App helps users set up the feature by selecting lights, activation mode (Manual/Automatic) and etc. The App communicates with the system through a cloud service as many other iOT products. <br> <br>
              	I feel very happy to have worked on this feature with the team, because it's a feature that is directly used by customers. And truely makes me feel proud when customers are using products that I have worked on!

          <div class="pane">
              <p>This project brought my understanding in Data Structures to a whole new level. It was a one-semester long project that was broken into 7 different phrases. This application recursively tokenized input expressions like (5+7*(10/2)) into numbers and operators to track the structures, which would be converted into a linked list. <br><br> 
              One phrase of the project was to use post-fix calculation on the linked list. Another phrase was to place the numbers and operators into a expression tree, then go through the tree to calculate the result. It could also do variable calculation retrieving data from a variable tree. For instance, if user define x=10, then (x+5) will return 15. In addition, this application also supported function definition such as gcf(a,b) and sqr(a). <br><br>
              To look back, I am very glad that I did this project. It was very crucial in enhancing my understanding in Data Structures. Although, I struggled through every phrase of it.</p>

          <div class="pane">
              <p>This was a project I did for my internship at Netsolace, which provided software support to Edible Arrangements. I was given the task to integrate their CRM portal with LogMeIn Rescue Remote Connection, so that the technicians would be able to use LogMeIn Rescue functionality on their own CRM portal. <br><br>
              The API used Http Web Request to verify the credentials of the technician. The communication method used in my project was HTTP GET. This protocol created a query string of the name and value pairs and then appended the query string to the URL of the script on the server that handled the request. If the credentials were valid, the technician would be able to log in his account and create pin codes for customers without getting on LogMeIn Rescue's website</p>

          <div class="pane">
              <p>
              Lutron's Smart Home product Caseta Wireless supports "scene", which allows user to define a scene by selecting a group of devices and their levels (eg: turn on Kitchen light and open bedroom shade). Scenes can be activated manually on the App or automatically through time clock schedule. <br><br> 
              This project's goal is to monitor users' light usage activities, and find trends to suggest scheduled scenes. For example, if a user turns on bedroom light and kitchen light around 7 AM everyday, the program should suggest them to set a scheduled scene to automate this event. <br><br>
              On a high level view, this project can be broken down to three parts: Collect data, Analyze to find trends, Present the scene to user. It's a co-op project meant for POC purpose, therefore I have been involved from end to end of this project. The program captures the live event data from the cloud, and analyze them when it has a stash of events. Then finally it needs to send the scene to users via the App to view and edit it.<br><br>
              Throughout the development of this feature, there were times that I felt frustrated because it was kind like "shooting in the dark" for me to come up with algorithm to find trends in data without any data science background. But there are also times I felt very motivated and excited when I see reasonable outputs from the program and positive feedbacks from testers. <br><br>
              Note: This feature has only been tested on internal users at Lutron, and it's not meant for Production cutomers yet. Production Customers light usage was never monitored during the development of this feature.

          <div class="pane">
              <p>Finally did I finish my Sales Analysis Map application! It's the most robust web application that I have ever done for Edible Arrangements. This mapping application will take live store sales data from Edible Arrangements' database, and populate the data into the map. The goal is to have more visualize sales data for the company to view. This is essentially a two-level map that combines the USA map and state maps after clicked. On the USA map, the total sales of a state will be presented and their distributions. After user clicks into a state, the map will zoom in to the specific state, and show stores' sales on their locations!

              <br>I have to admit that the entire process is a learning process for me. I have never dived so deep down into ASP.NET before. Being able to make some application for the company and help them to make better business decisions feels very much better than earning an A on homework. I am very thankful to having this project. </p>

When I came to my job, I knew nothing about ASP.NET programming, which was what my company primarily used for their websites. Then I bought a .NET book for about $30 and dived into it for two weeks. My manager then told me to practice by building a customer registration dashboard.<br><br>
              This application contains three main parts: login page, registration page and manager page. The user would register with their information such as name and email. The registration page contained validators that check the email, phone number, password strength and etc. The information would be stored in SQL database. After registration, the customers will be able to log in and see or edit their information. The manager page contains a table that has all customers' information.</p>
